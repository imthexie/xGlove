xGlove
======
* xGloveBTArduino contains the Arduino code. This continually checks sensor values and sends the data through Bluetooth. 
* xGlove is the Java code (we use Eclipse) that is run on the computer. To make it compatible with your OS, go into the xGlove folder and copy and paste the file from inside your corresponding OS into the main xGlove folder. 
* TO USE ECLIPSE: Make a folder outside of this xGlove repository folder called xGloveEclipseWorkspace. This is where your Eclipse Workspace should be pointed to. This avoids an Eclipse bug with project folders and project names. Import xGlove/xGlove as an Eclipse project, and don't select "Copy files into Workspace".
